I have inserted all the necessary items into this repository but it may be necessary to download Python and Pygame if the code does not load. This can be done using the following command in the terminal `pip install pygame` for pygame. The entire game should run off the file `main.py` and so is the only file that needs to be opened and executed. 

Please download all these files as they are seen in the repository, open `main.py` and find the `run` command in the menu bar usually located on the top left of your screen. Enjoy!
